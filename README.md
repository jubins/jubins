### Hello there,

Welcome to my GitHub. This is where my code lives (at least most of it, once it leaves my computer). I build things on occasion, believe it or not. Most of them involve software, systems, or poking at interesting problems until something useful (or at least fun) falls out.

I enjoy working across distributed systems, machine learning, security, and applied AI — especially when the result is something people can actually use. I also like experimenting, learning in public, and shipping side projects. When I’m not coding, I’m usually thinking about product ideas, game programming, or how to make systems a little more elegant (or at least less broken). I typically write on my [personal blog](https://jubinsoni.com), subscribe to my newsletter for awesome content on AWS, AI, Distributed Systems, GCP, DSA, and more!

Here are some opensource projects I made that you might like:

- **[RuntimePad](https://runtimepad.com/)** - A suite of dev tools and playground for running and sharing code snippets.

- **[Herald](https://www.herald.xyz/)** - A platform focused on modern newsletter publishing and content distribution.

- **[Machine Learning: Detecting Twitter Bots](https://github.com/jubins/MachineLearning-Detecting-Twitter-Bots)** - ML-based approaches to identifying automated behavior on X.

- **[Deep Learning: Food Image Recognition & Calorie Estimation](https://github.com/jubins/DeepLearning-Food-Image-Recognition-And-Calorie-Estimation)** - Computer vision + deep learning to recognize food and estimate calories.

- **[Keystroke Authentication](https://github.com/jubins/KeystrokesAuthentication)**  - Behavioral biometrics using keystroke dynamics for authentication.

- **[Distributed Systems: Key-Value Store Server](https://github.com/jubins/DistributedSystems-Key-Value-Store-Server)** - A distributed key-value store (like redis) exploring consistency, replication, and fault tolerance.

- **[AI Game Programming](https://github.com/jubins/AI-Game-Programming)** - Experiments with AI techniques applied to games.

- **[AES Secure Chat Messenger](https://github.com/jubins/AES-Secure-Chat-Messenger)**  - A secure chat messenger application using open web-sockets and end-to-end encryption.
